This project demonstrates the differences between Scala and Java
with regards to conciseness. 

The sample application is very simple. The goal is to print a list
the first names of people who are "valid" which here is defined as 
being over 18 from a list of Person objects which contain full name and age.    

The project contains examples of both Java and Scala code that performs
this simple task.  

To run either version simply use SBT invoke: 'sbt run'
You can download sbt here:

The project is inspired by this StackOverFlow question
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2952732/samples-of-scala-and-java-code-where-scala-code-looks-simpler-has-fewer-lines
and apparently in turn from "Begining Scala" by David Pollack
